# DataEngi-Task3
**1. Discover backend API for UI requests (https://github.com/dataengi/crm-seed) and save the result of testing as a project on the own repository. Create bug reports if they are.**
==================================
**Description of the testing process**

Testing was carried out manually using docker. Relying on API requests which are implemented in Swagger, which can find in docker by using port 9000 and adding " /docs" to link in the address bar. API requests were analyzed.
Requests were analyzed in such a way(on the example "Create a Contact Group"):

1. Consider individual requests
